/// Grassroots Networking Layer for GSG Protocol
/// 
/// This package provides a BLE mesh transport layer based on the Grassroots protocol.
/// It handles:
/// - BLE Central/Peripheral dual-mode operation
/// - Packet fragmentation and reassembly
/// - Mesh routing with TTL-based relay
/// - Duplicate detection via Bloom filter
/// - Store-and-forward for offline peers
/// 
/// ## Usage
/// 
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:grassroots_networking/grassroots_networking.dart';
/// 
/// // Create identity (provided by GSG layer)
/// final identity = GrassrootsIdentity(
///   publicKey: myPubKey,
///   privateKey: myPrivKey,
///   nickname: 'Alice',
/// );
/// 
/// // Create GrassrootsNetwork instance
/// final grassroots = GrassrootsNetwork(identity: identity);
/// 
/// // Set up callbacks
/// grassroots.onMessageReceived = (senderPubkey, payload) {
///   // Handle incoming GSG block
/// };
/// 
/// grassroots.onPeerConnected = (peer) {
///   // New peer available
/// };
/// 
/// // Initialize and start
/// await grassroots.initialize();
/// 
/// // Send messages
/// await grassroots.send(recipientPubkey, gsgBlockData);
/// await grassroots.broadcast(gsgBlockData);
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Architecture
/// 
/// The package is structured as follows:
/// 
/// - `GrassrootsNetwork` - Main API class for GSG integration
/// - `GrassrootsIdentity` - Ed25519 identity provided by GSG
/// - `Peer` - Represents a connected peer
/// - `MeshRouter` - Handles routing, relay, and fragmentation
/// - `BleManager` - Manages BLE Central and Peripheral roles
/// - `TransportService` - Abstract interface for transport implementations
/// 
/// ## Protocol Compatibility
/// 
/// This implementation follows the Grassroots protocol specification for
/// BLE mesh networking, ensuring compatibility with other Grassroots clients.
/// 
/// ## Transport Abstraction
/// 
/// The transport layer is abstracted via the `TransportService` interface,
/// allowing multiple transport implementations:
/// - `BleTransportService` - Bluetooth Low Energy mesh (default)
/// - Future: WebRTC transport (STUN/TURN/TURNS)
