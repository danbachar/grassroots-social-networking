///

/// 1. Handle peer discovery appropriate to the transport
/// 2. Manage connections to discovered peers
/// 3. Provide reliable data transmission (or indicate unreliability)
/// 4. Map transport-specific peer IDs to the common format

/// ```
/// create → initialize() → start() → [active use] → stop() → dispose()
/// ```
